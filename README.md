# SMS-SPAM-Detection
 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam). The primary goal is to develop a robust spam detection system that can help in filtering unwanted messages.

Features
Preprocessing of SMS text (e.g., lowercasing, removing special characters, stopwords).
Feature extraction using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF.
Implementation of popular machine learning models:
Naive Bayes Classifier
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization of results using a confusion matrix and graphs.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language
Pandas: For data manipulation
NumPy: For numerical operations
Scikit-learn: For model building and evaluation
NLTK/Spacy: For natural language preprocessing
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization
Dataset
The project uses a publicly available SMS spam dataset (e.g., UCI ML Repository). This dataset contains labeled SMS messages:

Spam: Messages that are classified as spam.
Ham: Legitimate messages that are not spam.
Steps in the Project
Data Loading:
Load the dataset and perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Data Preprocessing:
Clean text (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords).
Tokenize and vectorize the text using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.
Model Training:
Train machine learning models on the processed data.
Use cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment (Optional):
Deploy the trained model using a web framework like Flask or Streamlit.
